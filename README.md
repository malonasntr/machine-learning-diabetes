# 🩺 Multiclass Diabetes Classification
This project aims to classify diabetes into multiple categories using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/multiclass-diabetes-dataset).  
Machine learning algorithms are applied to analyze patient data and predict the level or type of diabetes based on several medical attributes.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Multiclass Diabetes Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/multiclass-diabetes-dataset)

The dataset includes multiple attributes such as:
- AGE  
- Gender  
- Urea  
- Cr  
- HbA1c 
- Chol  
- TG
- HDL
- LDL
- VLDL
- BMI
- Class (diabetes type)

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-----------|
| Gender | The biological sex of the individual. Usually encoded as: 0 = Female, 1 = Male. Gender can influence diabetes risk due to hormonal and lifestyle differences |
| AGE| The age of the individual in years. Age is a critical risk factor for diabetes, as the likelihood increases with age, especially after 45 |
| Urea | Measurement of urea in the blood (mg/dL). High levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, a common complication of diabetes. Normal range: ~7–20 mg/dL |
| Cr (Creatinine) | Measures the level of creatinine in the blood (mg/dL). Creatinine is an indicator of kidney function; elevated levels may suggest impaired kidney function often associated with diabetes. Normal range: 0.6–1.3 mg/dL |
| HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin) | A key indicator of average blood glucose levels over the past 2–3 months, expressed as a percentage. (Normal: <5.7% ; Prediabetic: 5.7–6.4% ; Diabetic: ≥6.5%) |
| Chol (Cholesterol) | Total cholesterol in the blood (mg/dL). High cholesterol increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and is commonly seen in diabetic individuals. Normal range: <200 mg/dL |
| TG (Triglycerides) | Measures the amount of fat in the blood (mg/dL). High triglycerides are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Normal range: <150 mg/dL |
| HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) | The “good” cholesterol (mg/dL). Higher levels are beneficial, helping remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream. (Ideal: >40 mg/dL (men) ; >50 mg/dL (women)) |
| LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) | The “bad” cholesterol (mg/dL). High levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries. Optimal range: <100 mg/dL |
| VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) | Another type of “bad” cholesterol that carries triglycerides. Often estimated as TG/5. Normal range: 2–30 mg/dL |
| BMI (Body Mass Index) | A measure of body fat based on height and weight (kg/m²). Obesity (BMI ≥30) is a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes (- Underweight: <18.5 ; Normal: 18.5–24.9 ; Overweight: 25–29.9 ; Obese: ≥30) |
| Class | Target label representing diabetes status. Encoded as: 0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic, 2 = Prediabetic. This is the variable the model aims to predict |

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Check duplicate and missing values 
   - Normalize/scale numerical features  

2. **Model Training**
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Decision Tree | 0.9811 | Memberikan hasil akurasi tinggi dengan sedikit kesalahan pada kelas “Diduga Diabetes”; model cukup baik namun masih berpotensi overfitting |
| Random Forest | 1.0000 | Mampu memprediksi seluruh kelas dengan sempurna tanpa kesalahan; menunjukkan generalisasi yang sangat baik |
| SVM | 0.9057 | Memiliki performa cukup baik namun cenderung kesulitan membedakan kelas “Diduga Diabetes”; sensitif terhadap skala fitur dan parameter kernel |
